Predicting Antarctic sea ice extent and climate patterns using historical satellite and weather data, powered by machine learning.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to forecast Antarctic sea ice extent using a combination of statistical models and deep learning techniques.  
It integrates datasets from NASA, NOAA, and Copernicus to analyze long-term climate trends and predict seasonal changes.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Collect and preprocess at least **30 years** of climate and sea ice data.
- Develop forecasting models (LSTM/Temporal CNN) for seasonal predictions.
- Compare deep learning models with classical time-series methods.
- Build an interactive dashboard to visualize forecasts.
- Publish results and methodology openly for research reuse.
